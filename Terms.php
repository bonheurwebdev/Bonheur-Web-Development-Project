        <p class="lead text-muted mb-0">
            Prices shown on the Site are in PHP (Philippine Pesos) and are inclusive of VAT at the applicable rate.
<p class="lead text-muted mb-0">
    All prices are correct at the time of entering the information on to the system. If for some reason we are unable to ship your goods, 
the value of the items that are not shipped will be refunded to your wallet in your Bonheur Account or to the original method of payment.
<p class="lead text-muted mb-0">
    Once you have made your choice and your order has been placed, you will receive an email acknowledging the details of your order. 
This email is not an acceptance of your order, just a confirmation that we have received it.
<p class="lead text-muted mb-0">
    Unless you cancel your order, acceptance of your order and completion of the contract between you and Bonheur.com.ph 
will be completed when we email you to confirm the goods have been dispatched. The sale contract is therefore concluded in the 
Philippines where our operation center is located and the language of the contract is English.
<p class="lead text-muted mb-0">
    Payment can be made by Cash On Delivery, Credit/Debit Card, Online Payment(GCash) and any other methods which may be clearly 
advertised on the Site from time to time. We take all reasonable care to make our Site secure.
